####MS5611 example

If you haven't already done that, download Navio drivers and examples code like this:

```bash
git clone www.github.com/emlid/navio
```


***C++***

Move to the folder with the source code, compile and run the example:

```
cd Navio/C++/Examples/Barometer
make
sudo ./Barometer
```

***Python***

Move to the folder with the code and run the example:

```
cd Navio/Python/Barometer
make
./Barometer
```

You should see pressure and temperature values. Keep in mind that board tends to get hot from Raspberry and would show slightly higher temperature than it is in your room.

```
Temperature(C): 34.3509172821 Pressure(millibar): 1030.4646104
Temperature(C): 34.2971904755 Pressure(millibar): 1030.4639519
Temperature(C): 34.2795449066 Pressure(millibar): 1030.45554448
Temperature(C): 34.3018652344 Pressure(millibar): 1030.46921925
```

####MS5611 code

Here is the main code, which is mostly self-explanatory. As it takes some time for the sensor to perform conversion delays are added between calls to methods that start the conversion and read the resulting data. After reading both pressure and temperature values temperature compensation can be performed to get resulting pressure value.

```C++
#include "Navio/MS5611.h"
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    MS5611 barometer;

    barometer.initialize();

    while (true) {
        barometer.refreshPressure();
        usleep(10000); // Waiting for pressure data ready
        barometer.readPressure();

        barometer.refreshTemperature();
        usleep(10000); // Waiting for temperature data ready
        barometer.readTemperature();

        barometer.calculatePressureAndTemperature();

        printf("Temperature(C): %f Pressure(millibar): %f\n",
                barometer.getTemperature(), barometer.getPressure());

        sleep(1);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
